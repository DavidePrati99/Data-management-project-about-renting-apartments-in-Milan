# Data-management-project-about-renting-apartments-in-Milan

The goal of this project is to create a tool that may help off-site students find the best
housing solution in Milan, taking into consideration the characteristics of the house,
its monthly rent, and the travel time and costs involved in reaching the university from
the selected house daily. To do so we decided to take into account just the possibility
of renting a house, and not to buy it, which is objectively unrealistic for a 20-year-old
student, even more so considering the rising prices. Similarly, it’s also relatively unrealistic
for said 20-year-old to own a car. That is why only public transport (i.e. train
and subway, or a combination of these) was considered when computing travel times.
In addition to this, we have decided not to neglect the aspect of entertainment and
social life, and also took into consideration a set of plausible interesting locations related
to this point and gathering demographic data about the area in which the house
is located, such as population density and average age. We are fully aware of the
fundamental role that mental health and leisure play in an off-site student’s quality of
life; and besides, why not benefit from the money saved from the rent to take care of it?

The solution we developed ultimately consists in a database of rent offers of the Milan
metropolitan area, collecting data about each specific listing and integrating it with
information about the house’s public transport connections to the city’s main points
of interest. Such a repository of data, other than being useful in searching the right
house based on a multitude of factors and characteristics, also opens up the possibility
to analyze Milan’s rent housing market as a whole through statistical and machine
learning techniques.
